        <h4><strong>About Miriam Garfinkle</strong></h4>

        <p>Miriam Garfinkle (April 24, 1954 &ndash; September 15, 2018) was a Canadian physician and social justice
            activist. She described herself as a humanist and eco-socialist who believed that we have to rid the world
            of
            capitalism.</p>

        <p>Raised in Toronto in a secular Jewish family by parents with a background in left-wing politics, she was
            politically active from an early age. Recalling her childhood in an interview, she said that she early on
            absorbed her family&#8217;s humanist values and their belief in acting on those values. When she was 14, she
            became involved in the local campaign to support the <a href="https://herb.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/2041"
                target='_blank'>United Farmworkers&#8217;</a>
            grape boycott, and later, while still in high school, was part of a women&#8217;s group providing birth
            control
            information to high school women. In her last year of high school, 1971-72, she attended a newly founded
            &lsquo;free school&rsquo; (AISP &ndash; Alternative Independent Study Program) which she had helped set up.
        </p>

        <p>In the latter half of the 1970s and the early 1980s, she was a member of the Toronto Liberation School, a
            libertarian socialist project which organized courses and discussions on topics such as Marxism, the
            environment, and the family. Miriam credited these discussions with helping her to develop and deepen her
            Marxist-humanist political views.</p>

        <p><b>Medicine and the politics of health</b></p>

        <p>Miriam studied medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, graduating in 1979. She subsequently
            worked
            in the Immigrant Women&#8217;s Health Centre in Toronto as well as in private practice. She was one of the
            founding members of the Medical Reform Group of Ontario, an organization of radical doctors and medical
            students
            which advocated for &#8220;the universal access of every person to high quality, appropriate health
            care&#8221;
            without monetary or other deterrents to equal care, and which said that &#8220;health care workers,
            including
            physicians, should seek out and recognize the social, economic, occupational and environmental causes of
            disease, and be directly involved in their eradication.&#8221; Miriam was one of the MRG&#8217;s
            spokespersons
            in advocating for medically insured free-standing abortion clinics.</p>

        <p>After some years in private practice, Miriam began working at the Regent Park Community Health Centre. She
            became
            an outspoken supporter of the community health centre model, with its emphasis on accountability to the
            community and on health care providers working together as a team. She advocated for the health and social
            needs
            of people living in poverty, refugees, and undocumented migrants, and also campaigned for increases in the
            minimum wage and for improved sick leave benefits, especially for precarious and minimum-wage workers.</p>

        <p><b>Zionism, Israel, and Palestine</b></p>

        <p>Miriam&#8217;s years in Jewish summer camps initially led her to believe in the possibility of a left-wing
            Zionism which could create a Jewish homeland while guaranteeing equal rights for Palestinians. Over time,
            she
            began to increasingly question those beliefs. One turning point, she later recalled, came in 1971, when as a
            sixteen-year-old she saw Gillo Pontecorvo&#8217;s film
            <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Algiers" target='_blank'>The Battle of
                    Algiers</a></i>.
            &#8220;A light went on in my head,&#8221; she said. Suddenly, she said, she saw the parallels between the
            anti-colonial struggles of the Algerians and the Palestinians. Later she came to draw parallels between the
            treatment of Palestinians in Israel and Indigenous peoples in Canada.</p>
            <div id="floating-img">
                <img src=".img/2014-08-10-IMG_1301-IAmJewish.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
        <p>Miriam became an outspoken opponent of Israel&#8217;s treatment of Palestinians, and a supporter of the
            Boycott,
            Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement aimed at pressuring Israel at ending its human rights abuses and
            theft
            of Palestinian land. She said that, as a Jew, she felt a special obligation to speak out about this and to
            say
            &#8220;Not in my name.&#8221; She was for years a member of a group which held a weekly educational vigil
            outside the Israeli consulate in Toronto, handing out literature about Israeli human-rights violations and
            engaging passers-by in conversation. She was the spokesperson for a group of Jewish women who occupied the
            Israeli consulate in Toronto when Israel attacked Gaza in January 2009.</p>

        <p>In early 2004, at a demonstration against the U.S. invasion of Iraq, she met Robert Massoud, who had recently
            founded <a href="https://zatoun.com/" target='_blank'>Zatoun</a>, a project to import Palestinian olive oil
            and
            other Palestinian products to Canada to create awareness for a just peace for Palestine-Israel, as well as
            to
            provide income for Palestinian farmers. Miriam agreed to become the first member of the Zatoun board, and
            started promoting and selling olive oil in her spare time, becoming what Robert described as &#8220;the #1
            Zatoun salesperson in the world&#8221;. Miriam described her volunteer involvement in Zatoun as
            &#8220;sustainable activism&#8221; and continued her involvement with Zatoun to the end of her life.</p>

        <p>Miriam spent a great deal of time out in nature, and she was also a committed environmentalist. She was
            active in
            anti-pipeline and anti-tar sands campaigns. A particular priority was environmental racism: the effects of
            the
            mining, oil, and other industries on Indigenous communities. After she retired, Miriam was heavily involved
            in
            the campaign against Enbridge&#8217;s Line 9. Her opposition was based on the risks posed by Line 9 itself,
            especially the danger of spills contaminating the drinking water of Indigenous and other communities, and
            equally on her opposition to the tar sands, a major contributor to climate change.</p>

        <section id="aboutMiriam" data-aos="fade-up">
        <p><b>Humanism and eco-socialism</b></p>

        <p>Miriam always described herself as a humanist, which to her implied socialism. Socialism to her meant, not
            minor
            adjustments to the status quo, but a commitment to ridding the world of capitalism. She also believed that
            socialism had to mean transforming our environment-destroying societies to live in harmony with nature, and
            in
            later years, she began to refer to herself as an ecosocialist. In an interview, she summarized what acting
            as a
            humanist meant to her with the observation that &#8220;All there is, is us. There is no one but us to do
            this.&#8221; </p>

        <p>Miriam&#8217;s partner <a href="https://www.connexions.org/CxLibrary/Docs/CxP-Diemer_Ulli.htm"
                target='_blank'>Ulli Diemer</a> commented that &#8220;she was always strategic. It might sometimes seem
            that
            Miriam involved herself in many different issues, and in a sense that&#8217;s true. But in a deeper sense,
            she
            only had one issue: building a world based on justice and community where people live in harmony with the
            planet.&#8221; </p>

        <p>Miriam died of cancer in 2018, at the age of 64.</p>
